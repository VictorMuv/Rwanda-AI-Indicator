# Rwanda-AI-Indicator
# Attempt to visualize AI and Data commits of Rwandan

## Introduction

The AI readiness and maturity framework acknowledges that the availability of a skilled workforce in AI and Data-related disciplines is relatively low. However, there are claims suggesting that Rwandans are increasingly contributing to AI and Data projects, as indicated by the number of git commits. This project aims to fact check this claim and gain insights into the trends and growth of AI and Data-related activities in Rwanda.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to visualize the git commits made by Rwandans in the field of AI and Data. By analyzing the commit data over time, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and any significant growth in the number of AI and Data-related projects undertaken by the Rwandan community. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the state of AI and Data in Rwanda and help assess the progress made in these domains.

## Methodology

To achieve our objective, we leverage the GitHub API to retrieve commit data specific to Rwandan contributors. Using Python and data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, we create visualizations that showcase the trends and growth of AI and Data-related git commits over time. By examining the patterns in the data, we can draw conclusions about the level of activity and engagement in AI and Data projects within the Rwandan community.

## Results and Insights

Through our analysis, we aim to provide evidence-based insights into the level of AI and Data activity among Rwandan developers. The visualizations and trends discovered in this project will shed light on the progress made in the field of AI and Data, identify areas of growth, and contribute to the overall understanding of the Rwandan AI and Data ecosystem.

## Conclusion

By fact-checking the claim of an upward trend in AI and Data-related git commits by Rwandans, we hope to gain a better understanding of the current state of AI and Data in Rwanda. This project contributes to the larger discourse on AI readiness and maturity in the country, highlighting the efforts and contributions of Rwandan developers in these domains.
